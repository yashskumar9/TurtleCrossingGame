## Introduction

The Turtle Crossing Game is inspired by the classic arcade game "Frogger." Players control a turtle that must navigate across a road filled with moving cars. Each successful crossing advances the player to the next level, where the cars move even faster, making the game more challenging and engaging.

## Features

- **User Control**: Move the turtle forward using the `Up Arrow` key.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Cars are generated dynamically at random positions, creating unpredictable obstacles.
- **Level Progression**: Each successful crossing advances the player to the next level.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Car speeds increase with each level, adding to the challenge.
- **Game Over Display**: A "Game Over" message appears when the turtle collides with a car.
